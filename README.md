## How I Built It

This project was built using a modern tech stack to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.

### Frontend

- **React.js**: The frontend of the website is built using React.js, allowing for a dynamic and responsive interface.
- **Custom CSS**: I wrote custom CSS to handle layout, styling, and responsiveness. The design ensures that the application is visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **Icons**: FontAwesome was used for various icons throughout the application, providing intuitive and recognizable symbols for the user interface.

### Backend

- **Node.js & Express**: The backend of the website is built using Node.js and Express.js. It handles requests such as searching for photographers, submitting forms, and user authentication.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is used for the database to store user data, photographer profiles, and other relevant information.
- **API**: An API was created to handle search queries and retrieve data from the database. It supports searching photographers by location and specialization.

### User Registration and Authentication

- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure user authentication. Users can log in to their account, manage their profile, and make sure their data is protected.
- **Form Handling**: The forms for photographer registration and search inputs are built with React's state management, ensuring smooth user interaction.

### Profile Icon

A profile icon is included on the top right corner of the page, which allows users to quickly navigate to their profile section. This icon changes based on whether the user is logged in or not.
